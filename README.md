# Fungal_Pathogen_Analysis_On_European_Forests


The project explores how tree species diversity affects foliar fungal disease incidence in European forests. It investigates the relationship between tree diversity and disease, utilizing field data across various forest types. The study employs machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting, to predict fungal disease incidence. Findings aim to inform forest management strategies, emphasizing the importance of species diversity in maintaining forest health and mitigating disease.


# Futuer Scope


- The future scope of this project could explore advanced modeling techniques for more accurate predictions, expand the dataset to include more diverse forest ecosystems, and examine the impact of other environmental factors on disease incidence. Integrating remote sensing data could offer insights into large-scale patterns and trends. 

- Collaboration with ecological researchers and policymakers could also lead to the development of targeted conservation strategies, contributing to healthier forests and mitigating the effects of climate change on disease dynamics.
